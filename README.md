This Python code converts a decimal number into its binary equivalent. Hereâ€™s a brief description:

Code Breakdown:
Function Definition:

def d_to_b(values): defines a function named d_to_b that takes a single argument values, which is the decimal number to be converted to binary.
Initialize an Empty List:

remainder = [] initializes an empty list to store the binary digits (0s and 1s).
Loop to Generate Binary Digits:

while values > 0: starts a loop that runs until the decimal number (values) is reduced to 0.
a = values % 2 calculates the remainder when values is divided by 2 (either 0 or 1).
remainder.append(a) appends this remainder (binary digit) to the remainder list.
values = values // 2 updates values by dividing it by 2 and discarding the remainder.
Reverse and Convert to String:

remainder.reverse() reverses the list because the binary digits are generated in reverse order.
return ''.join(map(str, remainder)) converts the list of binary digits into a string and returns it.
User Input and Output:

values = int(input("enter decimal value")) prompts the user to enter a decimal number, which is converted to an integer.
print(d_to_b(values)) calls the d_to_b() function with the user input and prints the binary equivalent.
